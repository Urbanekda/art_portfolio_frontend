# üñºÔ∏è Art Portfolio Frontend

Portfolio project I built and designed for my friend. It is intended to showcase his work with an explanation and provide a contact point for potential clients. The main section fetches artwork data from a Strapi CMS for easier management and updating. Tailwind was used to help style the project.

## What I Learned

This was my first project, created for and with another person. I have quite enjoyed our collaboration as we iterated over the design together. The design itself is intended to capture and reflect my friend's visual style while providing high usability and clear navigation.

The communication between frontend and backend part (Strapi CMS) was also new to me and I have learned a lot about APIs and HTTP requests from this project.

Deploying the project I have learned how to use virtual machines on Microsoft Azure and configure the deployment with an open-source implementation of Heroku, [Dokku](https://dokku.com/). Thinking about the economic aspects of this project I tried to optimize resource usage and virtual machine configuration.
